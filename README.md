## Installation

Installation is most easily done using the setup.py file that can be found in this repository. However, installation does depend on the [Click library](https://github.com/pallets/click) for user configuration options. If you haven't already installed it, then go ahead and install that before proceeding with the following commands on the command line:

```
$ python3 setup.py
```

## Usage

The structure of most all commands will be roughly as follows:

```
$ ff [file or directory name] [-flag]
```

The file or directory name option should be self evident.

You can also always type
```
$ ff --help
```
to remind yourself of the available commands if you ever forget.
